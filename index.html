      <h1>An example of what a game is</h1>
      <h2>Guardian Tales is simply a masterpiece of a pixel game</h2>
      <p>Guardian Tale sets a perfect example how a story and game should be told. Gmeplay wise, it isnt bad, but what makes a game good is how it's told and played out. Guardian Tale shows a good way how to tell a story and give some difficulty for the player to engage in and have fun at the same time. it also gives free items for the player to progress further in to the game.  </p>
      <p>Aside from that, players can experience many emotions in the story, and feel sympathy with the characters. And speaking of characters, they're all unique and interesting in their own way. And the game gives so much depth and story in these characters, it's amazing it's all told in a fairly short amount of time. The writers of the game truly does deserve some sort of reward for their hard work and passion for the game. and the fact that it isn't the full game
